# Ionic Development Server Guidelines

## Default Development Command

**Always use `ionic serve` for development unless there is an explicit need to use `npm run dev`.**

## Preferred Command

```bash
ionic serve
```

## When to Use Each Command

### Use `ionic serve` (Preferred)
- **Default choice** for all development work
- Provides Ionic CLI integration and tooling
- Better error reporting for Ionic-specific issues
- Supports Ionic DevApp for mobile testing
- Includes Ionic CLI live reload features
- Integrates with Capacitor for native development
- Provides better debugging for Ionic components

### Use `npm run dev` (Only When Needed)
- When debugging Vite-specific configuration issues
- When you need Vite's specific dev server features
- When working on build tooling or Vite plugins
- When `ionic serve` encounters compatibility issues
- When explicitly testing Vite's HMR behavior

## Command Comparison

| Feature | `ionic serve` | `npm run dev` |
|---------|---------------|---------------|
| **Default Choice** | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| **Ionic Integration** | ✅ Full | ⚠️ Limited |
| **Live Reload** | ✅ Ionic-optimized | ✅ Standard |
| **Mobile Testing** | ✅ DevApp support | ❌ Manual setup |
| **Error Reporting** | ✅ Ionic-aware | ✅ Vite standard |
| **Capacitor Integration** | ✅ Built-in | ⚠️ Manual |

## Development Workflow

### Starting Development
```bash
# Preferred - use this by default
ionic serve

# Only use when specifically needed
npm run dev
```

### With Capacitor (Mobile Development)
```bash
# For iOS development with live reload
ionic capacitor run ios --livereload

# For Android development with live reload  
ionic capacitor run android --livereload
```

### Build Commands
```bash
# Development build
ionic build

# Production build
ionic build --prod

# Or use npm scripts
npm run build
```

## Port and Configuration

- **Default Port**: `ionic serve` typically uses port 8100
- **Vite Port**: `npm run dev` uses port 5173
- Both support custom port configuration

## Best Practices

1. **Start with `ionic serve`** for all development sessions
2. **Switch to `npm run dev`** only when troubleshooting specific issues
3. **Use Capacitor commands** for mobile device testing
4. **Prefer Ionic CLI** for consistency with Ionic ecosystem
5. **Document exceptions** when `npm run dev` is required

## Common Scenarios

### Standard Development Session
```bash
ionic serve
# Opens http://localhost:8100
```

### Testing on Mobile Device
```bash
ionic serve --external
# Accessible on local network for mobile testing
```

### Debugging Build Issues
```bash
npm run dev
# Use only when ionic serve doesn't help identify the issue
```

## Environment Variables

Both commands respect the same environment variables from `.env` files, but `ionic serve` provides better integration with Ionic's configuration system.
